  skill before each task, process skills first."

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

## The Rule

Check for a relevant skill before starting any task, and invoke the ones that apply — if a skill turns out wrong for the situation, you don't have to use it.

**Before entering plan mode:** if you haven't already brainstormed, invoke the brainstorming skill first.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills apply, process skills come first — they set the approach, then implementation skills (frontend-design, etc.) carry it out. Brainstorming and systematic-debugging are Superpowers' most common process skills, but the rule holds for any of them.

- "Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
- "Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then domain skills.

## User Instructions

User instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc, direct requests) take precedence over skills, which in turn override default behavior. Only skip skill workflows or instructions when your human partner has explicitly told you to.
